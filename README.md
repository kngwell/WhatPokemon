# What Pokemon

An online app that pulls from the Poke API to generate a random team of pokemon.

## Description

This webpage uses the Poke API and a random number generator function to pull a team of 6 random Pokemon from the selected generation to give the user a team of pokemon that they probably wouldint run normally

## Installation instructions

## Why?
Because it's fun! so often when you play a pokemon game, people try to min/max or just use the same favorites. This will give you a new way to play the game where you might be playing the game with 5 Magikarps and a Mewtwo!

## Hurdles
This project really gave me a run for my money at first.  I learned a lot about being willing to pivot from ideas of how I should go about doing things, as the initial way I planned on doing this ended up not being viable.  I chased that method for 3 days before I realized it wasn't viable.  Even with that roadblock, I was able to come up with a project that I feel really proud of, and I feel like I learned a TON about React and APIs.
